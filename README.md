# LunarBlocks
*Submission for HackTheU: Go Beyond hackathon (Fall 2020).*

**Created by:** Jan Garong, Jesse Maltese, Yining Wang, Rahul Sharma

**Built with:** pygame, pygame_gui

A simple game that would help younget students understand programming.

## Inspiration
With [the Ontario Math Curriculum now adding a coding component to Grades 1-8](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/americas/ontario-math-curiculum-trnd/index.html#:~:text=Court%20confirmation%20hearings-,Ontario%20schools%20will%20now%20teach%20first%20graders%20financial%20literacy%20and,for%20jobs%20of%20the%20future&text=The%20new%20curriculum%2C%20announced%20by,the%20course%20of%20two%20years.), we want to develop a game/tool that will help younger students develop their coding skills, without having to write code.

## What it does

## How we built it
We held group conference at the beginning of the hackathon, brainstormed, and come up with the idea to develop a game that benefits the younger students in computer science learning. Then we assigned task to every team member by grouping people into frontend and backend, and had online meetings to check the progress. By developing the game in python and pygame, we implemented the demo of LunarBlocks.

## Challenges we ran into
We confronted challenges when we tried to connect UI with backend. We found that there was diversion on functionality of some classes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Firstly it is worth spending time on the overall project planning and structuring so that the teamwork would efficient. Moreover, we learnt proper time management and tasks assignment to teammates.
